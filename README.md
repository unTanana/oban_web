Oban Web is a view of [Oban's][oba] inner workings that you host directly within your application.
Powered by [Oban Metrics][met] and [Phoenix Live View][liv], it is distributed, lightweight, and
fully realtime.

## Features

- **🐦‍🔥 Embedded LiveView** - Mount the dashboard directly in your application without any
  external dependencies.

- **📊 Realtime Charts** - Powered by a custom, distributed time-series data store that's compacted
  for hours of efficient storage and filterable by node, queue, state, and worker.

- **🛸 Live Updates** - Monitor background job activity across all queues and nodes in real
  time, with customizable refresh rates and automatic pausing on blur.

- **🔍 Powerful Filtering** - Intelligently filter jobs by worker, queue, args, tags and more with
  auto-completed suggestions.

- **🔬 Detailed Inspection** - View job details including when, where and how it was ran (or how
  it failed to run).

- **🔄 Batch Actions** - Cancel, delete and retry selected jobs or all jobs matching the current
  filters.

- **🎛️ Queue Controls** - Scale, pause, resume, and stop queues across all running nodes. Queues
  running with [Oban Pro](https://oban.pro) can also edit global limits, rate limiting, and
  partitioning.

- **♊ Multiple Dashboards** - Switch between all running Oban instance from a single mount point,
  or restrict access to some dashboards with exclusion controls.

- **🔒 Access Control** - Allow admins to control queues and interract with jobs while restricting
  other users to read-only use of the dashboard.

- **🎬 Action Logging** - Use telemetry events to instrument and report all of a user's dashboard
  activity. A telemetry-powered logger is provided for easy reporting.

## Installation

See the [installation guide](https://hexdocs.pm/oban_web/installation.html) for details on
installing and configuring Oban Web for your application.

## Job Logs

This fork includes an optional job logs panel on the job detail page. It captures Oban lifecycle
telemetry and `Logger` events emitted while a job is running.

Install the host app migration:

```bash
mix oban_web.job_logs.install --repo MyApp.Repo
mix ecto.migrate
```

The generated migration delegates to `Oban.Web.JobLogs.Migration`. At runtime,
Oban Web infers the repo from Oban telemetry metadata and the PubSub server from
the dashboard endpoint.

### Standalone Docker Image

A standalone Docker image is available for monitoring Oban without embedding the dashboard in your
application:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@host:5432/myapp" \
  -p 4000:4000 \
  ghcr.io/oban-bg/oban-dash
```

See the [standalone guide](https://hexdocs.pm/oban_web/standalone.html) for configuration options
and details.

## Contributing

To run the Oban Web test suite you must have PostgreSQL 12+ and MySQL 8+ running. Once dependencies
are installed, setup the databases and run necessary migrations:

```bash
mix test.setup
```

### Development Server

For development, a single file server that generates a wide variety of fake jobs is built in:

```bash
iex -S mix dev
```

### Python Development Workers

A Python development app is available that runs alongside the Elixir dev server, sharing the same
database. Python workers use separate queues (inference, scraping, etl, webhooks, notifications,
transcoding, maintenance) and are tagged with "python" for easy filtering in the dashboard.

First, install the Python dependencies (requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)):

```bash
mix py.install
```

Then, with the Elixir dev server running in one terminal, start the Python workers in another:

```bash
mix py.dev
```

Alternatively, run directly from the py directory:

```bash
cd py && uv run py-dev
```

### Testing with Oban Pro

Oban Pro is an optional dependency for development and testing. The test suite will automatically
skip Pro-dependent tests (tagged with `@tag :pro`) when Oban Pro is not available.

To run tests with Pro features, you'll need access to a valid [Oban Pro](https://oban.pro)
license. First, authorize with the Oban repository:

```bash
mix hex.repo add oban https://repo.oban.pro \
  --fetch-public-key SHA256:4/OSKi0NRF91QVVXlGAhb/BIMLnK8NHcx/EWs+aIWPc \
  --auth-key YOUR_AUTH_KEY
```

Then fetch dependencies and run the full test suite:

```bash
mix deps.get
mix test
```

To explicitly run tests without Oban Pro:

```bash
mix test --exclude pro
```
